1 Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.\
2 Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.\
3 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:\
4 That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.\
5 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.\
6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.\
7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.\
8 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.
